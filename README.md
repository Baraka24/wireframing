# Wireframing

Wireframing is the practice of creating low-fidelity layouts that map the structure, hierarchy, and flow of a product or page. It focuses on placement, navigation, and key interactions—without final visuals, colors, or copy.

## What Is Wireframing?
- Visual blueprint of screens and states
- Emphasizes content priority, layout, and user flows
- Uses simple shapes and labels to represent components

## Why It Matters
- Aligns stakeholders on scope and expectations early
- Validates requirements and user journeys before costly design/build
- Accelerates iteration and reduces rework
- Improves communication across design, product, and engineering

## Where It Fits in the Design Process
- Early discovery and requirements gathering
- Information architecture and user flow exploration
- Prior to high-fidelity design, prototyping, and implementation
- As a reference during usability testing and refinement

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

### Layout Structure
- Defines grid, columns, spacing, and breakpoints; establishes visual hierarchy.
- Contributes by guiding attention and aligning components consistently.
- Example: A three-column grid with a fixed 240px sidebar keeps filters accessible on desktop; collapses to a drawer on mobile to preserve content space.

### Navigation
- Specifies global, local, and contextual navigation and their states.
- Contributes by clarifying paths, reducing backtracking, and surfacing key routes.
- Example: Top-level tabs for Dashboard, Reports, Settings; breadcrumbs within Reports; a sticky subnav exposing Overview, Trends, Export on long pages.

### Content Placement
- Positions headlines, primary/secondary content, and metadata using hierarchy.
- Contributes by prioritizing what users see first and supporting scanning (F/Z patterns).
- Example: KPI cards above the fold with clear labels; detailed table below; helper text adjacent to form fields to reduce errors.

### Functionality
- Maps interactions, controls, and states (hover, focus, disabled, loading, empty, error).
- Contributes by setting expectations for behavior and edge cases before visual design.
- Example: Inline edit in tables with validation; optimistic save with a toast; an empty state offering “Try a sample dataset” to unblock first-time users.
