# Wireframing

Wireframing is the practice of creating low-fidelity layouts that map the structure, hierarchy, and flow of a product or page. It focuses on placement, navigation, and key interactionsâ€”without final visuals, colors, or copy.

## What Is Wireframing?
- Visual blueprint of screens and states
- Emphasizes content priority, layout, and user flows
- Uses simple shapes and labels to represent components

## Why It Matters
- Aligns stakeholders on scope and expectations early
- Validates requirements and user journeys before costly design/build
- Accelerates iteration and reduces rework
- Improves communication across design, product, and engineering

## Where It Fits in the Design Process
- Early discovery and requirements gathering
- Information architecture and user flow exploration
- Prior to high-fidelity design, prototyping, and implementation
- As a reference during usability testing and refinement
